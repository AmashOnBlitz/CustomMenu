# Custom Menu (Win32)

A custom-drawn Win32 menu implementation written in **pure C** using the Windows API (GDI).
This project explores manual menu rendering, text measurement, borders, hover effects,
and low-level UI control without relying on default Windows menus.

> Built as a learning + experimentation project for understanding Win32 internals.
>
> Project Completed!
